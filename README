javap-mode
==========

Use `javap` to disassemble java classfiles and display the bytecode of
.class files in a readable manner.

When you load a .class file, you should see a syntax-highlighed javap
output. The syntax hilighting is a work in progress.

Installation
------------

This package is avialable on MELPA. The marmalade version is out of date.

Using MELPA, install it using `M-x package-install RET javap-mode RET`.

Otherwise, download the `javap-mode.el` file, open it in emacs and use
`M-x package-install-from-buffer`.

If you are using a really old version of emacs, you can also do
`(require 'java-mode "path/to/where/you/placed/javap-mode.el")` in
your `init.el`.

Usage
-----

Simply install the package. This package will automatically activate
on opening a java .class file.


Future Tasks
------------

- Better hilighting would be nice, also some way to step though
  varying levels of verbosity of javap output

- Would be nice to hit enter on line in line number table and jump to
  the line in the method's bytecode
